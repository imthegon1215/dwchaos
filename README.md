# DW Chaos!
You can distribute the script but not copy, but who cares.
This is a script related to Decaying Winter. It is made from parts of other scripts, maybe some of the features look familiar to you.
It's not done yet, but you can already play with it.
Benefits for now:
Buffed Lazarus and Executioner, this is what you can't find on other scripts.
Buffed Arbiter & Zealot & Hivemind
(Zealot isnt added)
